I am especially interested in programming languages and Computer Science education. You can see my Resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4eAwTi304XcMW8zQXBCOWw1QWc/view?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n## Projects  \r\n### Implemented tuples for [Pyret](https://code.pyret.org) programming language.  \r\n[Pyret](https://code.pyret.org) is a programming language designed for programming education used as part of the [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/index.shtml) curriculum and in undergraduate introductory computer science courses. Over summer 2016, I modified Pyret's compiler to enable the use of tuples in the language. I also attended [CSPD week](http://www.cspdweek.org/) as a facilitator for Bootstrap. Visit [here](https://pyret-horizon.herokuapp.com/editor#share=0B4eAwTi304XcanAwR3BjaWpWeFk) to see some examples of tuples in Pyret. \r\n\r\n### Compiler implemented in OCaml\r\nAs part of a course assignment, I implemented a compiler that has several features including let bindings, function applications, if statements, unary and binary operators, and register allocation. I also built a garbage collector in C. To see the code for this project, please contact me for a link.\r\n\r\n### Plagiarism Detector  \r\nAs part of a course assignment, I built a plagiarism detector that compares several documents for similarities. It utilizes either LinkedBSTs or AVLTrees to compare the documents. To see the code for this project, please contact me for a link. \r\n\r\n### Unix Shell\r\nAs part of a course assignment, I implemented a Unix Shell. This shell has the ability to run processes in the foreground and the background and also has several built in commands including 'history' and 'exit'. To see the code for this project, please contact me for a link.\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nEmail: sfischm1@swarthmore.edu    \r\nLinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahkf>  \r\nGitHub: <https://github.com/sarahkf>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
