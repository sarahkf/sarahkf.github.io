I am especially interested in programming languages and Computer Science education.\r\n\r\n## Projects  \r\n### Implemented tuples for [Pyret](https://code.pyret.org) programming language.  \r\n[Pyret](https://code.pyret.org) is a programming language designed for programming education used as part of the [Bootstrap](http://www.bootstrapworld.org/index.shtml) curriculum and in undergraduate introductory computer science courses. Over summer 2016, I modified Pyret's compiler to enable the use of tuples in the language. I also attended [CSPD week](http://www.cspdweek.org/) as a facilitator for Bootstrap. Visit [here](https://pyret-horizon.herokuapp.com/editor#share=0B4eAwTi304XcanAwR3BjaWpWeFk) to see some examples of tuples in Pyret.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nEmail: sfischm1@swarthmore.edu    \r\nLinkedIn: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-fischmann-4050b5100>  \r\nGitHub: <https://github.com/sarahkf>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
