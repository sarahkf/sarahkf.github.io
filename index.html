										<h2>Sarah Fischmann</h2>
										<p>Computer Science Major at Swarthmore College</p>
									</header>
									<p>I'm a Computer Science major with minors in Philosophy and Educational Studies. I am especially interested in programming languages and Computer Science education. For fun I like to play the clarinet, read, and dance Tango! You can find my resume <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4eAwTi304XcMW8zQXBCOWw1QWc/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

									<h3>Skills</h3>
									<p>I have experience programming in many different contexts with many different technologies. From course labs to computer science research to software engineering at a company, I have gained a wide range of skills. <strong>Click on any of the icons to see a more detailed description of each skill</strong>.</p>
									<ul class="feature-icons">
										<li class="fa-file-code-o" onclick=display("code")>Fluent in Python, C, C++
											<div id="code" style="display: none;">
  												<p>In my Computer Science courses at Swarthmore, I am required to complete weekly labs. Most of these labs are implemented in Python, C, or C++ so I have gained fluency in these three languages. I also worked with Python during my internship at edX.</p> 
											</div> </li>
										<li class="fa-code-fork" onclick=display("GitHub")>GitHub
											<div id="GitHub" style="display: none;">
												<p>In my Computer Science courses at Swarthmore, I am required to complete weekly labs. These labs are submitted using GitHub which gave me experience using commands such as git clone, pull, and push. In my time at edX, I learned a lot more about version control including branching, pull requests, rebasing, merging, and more.</p>
											</div> </li>
										<li class="fa-keyboard-o" onclick=display("Accessibility")>Experience with Website Accessibility
											<div id="Accessibility" style="display: none;">
												<p>During my internship at edX, I mostly worked on accessibility of the website. This allowed me to learn a lot about best practices for making a website accessible, especially for screen reader users.</p>
											</div> </li>
										<li class="fa-code" onclick=display("frontend")>Familiar with JavaScript, React, HTML
											<div id="frontend" style="display: none;">
												<p>I worked on the compiler of a language called Pyret as part of a summer research project, which was implemented in Pyret as well as JavaScript. This allowed me to gain some initial experience working with JavaScript. When I was at edX, I worked mostly on the front end, which gave me the ability to work with JavaScript, React, and HTML. In React, I implemented an accessible checkbox for the website as well as set up testing for React components using Jest and Enzyme.</p>
											</div> </li>
										<li class="fa-terminal" onclick=display("OS")>Unix/Linux, iOS, Windows
											<div id="OS" style="display: none;">
												<p>All Swarthmore Computer Science computers run Unix/Linux, my edX laptop ran iOS, and my personal laptops have always run Windows! Because of this I am comfortable using all three operating systems and using both the Mac and Linux terminals.</p>
											</div> </li>
										<li class="fa-edit" onclick=display("LaTex")>LaTex
											<div id="LaTex" style="display: none;">
												<p>Many Swarthmore classes that are focused on proof writing require assignments to be written in LaTex. Because of this I have gained familiarity using the language.</p>

									<h3>Selected Projects</h3>
									<p>I have had the opportunity to work on many different projects. Here are descriptions of just a few.</p>
									<div class="features">
										<article>
											<div>
												<h4>Implemented tuples for Pyret programming language</h4>
												<p><a href="https://code.pyret.org/">Pyret</a> is a programming language designed for programming education used as part of the <a href="http://www.bootstrapworld.org/index.shtml">Bootstrap</a> curriculum and in undergraduate introductory computer science courses. Over summer 2016, I modified Pyret's compiler to enable the use of tuples in the language. I also attended <a href="http://www.cspdweek.org/">CSPdWeek</a> as a facilitator for Bootstrap. Visit <a href="https://pyret-horizon.herokuapp.com/editor#share=0B4eAwTi304XcanAwR3BjaWpWeFk">here</a> to see some examples of tuples in Pyret or <a href="https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/research/summer2016/sfischm1.html">here</a> to see a more detailed description of my project.</p>

											<div>
												<h4>What's Cookin' Good Lookin'</h4>
												<p>For this project, I used artificial intelligence techniques to attempt to solve the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/whats-cooking">"What's Cooking?" Kaggle Competition</a>. The goal of this competition was to build a kernel that could take in a recipe and return the food category of that recipe. I used algorithms such as Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors. To see the code for this project, please contact me for a link.</p>

										<article>
											<div>
												<h4>Compiler implemented in OCaml</h4>
												<p>As part of a course assignment, I implemented a compiler that has several features including let bindings, function applications, if statements, unary and binary operators, and register allocation. I also built a garbage collector in C. To see the code for this project, please contact me for a link.</p>
											</div>
										</article>
										<article>
											<div>
												<h4>Plagiarism Detector</h4>
												<p>As part of a course assignment, I built a plagiarism detector that compares several documents for similarities. It utilizes either LinkedBSTs or AVLTrees to compare the documents. To see the code for this project, please contact me for a link.</p>
